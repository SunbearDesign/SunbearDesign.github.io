						<h4>
							Master Thesis Project
						</h4>		      
						<p>
							Ok, so here's the situation: Over the summer of 21' the price of electricity has soared. This means that all of a sudden, people are caring about the hour-by-hour electricity price, and trying to use appliances when the price is low. Having never done this before, there is obviously a lot of confusion about what makes an impact, and how to do this effectively. Additionally, in a country like Denmark, where the availability of sustainable electricity comes and goes with the wind, this also provides an opportunity to nudge people towards shifting their electricity usage to periods with an abundance of sustainable electricity. <br> <br> 
							Therefore, for my master thesis project I designed an app intended to help people reduce their electricity spending through helping shift their electricity usage, while also reduciinig their environmental impact. <br>
							The project was completed in collaboration with NRGi, and was based on a participatory design process. <br> <br>
						</p>
						<h4>
							Pre-project
						</h4>

						<p>
							Before the actual master thesis project, I conducted a pre-project focused on on user research. <br>
							First, I conducted a group interview focused on how people currently felt about their electricity usage, the ways in which they controlled it, and their challenges and motivations associated with this. <br>
							<br>
							I then created three simple prototype-concepts, which were presented to a group of people to discuss and build upon.
						</p>   

					 		<img
               						src="images/Prototypes.png" alt="" class="media"
             						/>
						<br>
						<h4>
							Deployment
						</h4>
					      
						<p>
							I then designed a prototype version of the app, and (through some Figma trickery) created a functional version fit for a deployment test.<br>

							<img
               						src="images/funcproto.png" alt="" class="media"
             						/>
							<br>
							
							Using this app, I conducted a deployment test with six participants across four households. Each participant was asked to use the app for one week, and I conducted interviews with each participant before and after the deployment. <br>
							<br>
							The post-deployment interviews were analyzed in a top-down manner using a practice framework created by Shove et al as the categorization framework.
						</p>
						   	<img
               						src="images/group330.png" alt="" class="media"
             						/>
						   	<br>
						<p>
						   	For this, I first coded all of the interviews, creating codes related to desires, challenges, ideas, etc. <br>
						   	I then clustered all similar ideas, before categorizing them in the framework. <br>
							Lastly, i drew connections between clusters that related to one another, or were interdependent. <br>
							From this, a total of 13 interconnected elements were uncovered. These elements and their connections functioned as requirements for the final design.
						</p>
						<h4>
							Final Design
						</h4> 
						<p>
							Lastly, I created the final prototype through a typical iterative design process, using the aforementioned requirements to justify and create features. <br>

							STRNGTHN
						</h4>	

						<p>
							Working out is hard. It requires commitment and consistency, and relies on small regular improvements. Tracking these over long periods can be difficult, and sometimes make it seem like nothing is happening. Additionally, the whole thing only works if you eat right. Even just knowing what to do, which exercises and when, can be a lot to overcome, especially for newcomers. <br>
							Based on my experience with all of this, and using fitness and nutrition apps, I developed the concept for STRNGTHN <br> <br>
							STRNGTHN combines features from three of the biggest apps in nutrition, training, and fitness programming, namely MyFitnessPal, RP Hypertrophy App, and Boostcamp. By doing so, the user is able to better understand the overlap between these three aspects, and how they affect each other.
						</p>

						<p>
							While still a work in progress, STRNGTHN currently consists of 6 screens with a complete design system with styles and components for a light and dark mode.
						</p>

						<p>

					      <h4>Study Space Spotter</h4>		      
					      	<p>
							For my bachelor thesis project, I took part in creating an interactive map for Aalborg University Library.
							For this project, I took on a role mainly focused on conducting UX-research. <br>
						        As part of this I conducted interviews with representatives of the library and its users, and conducted usability tests with six participants. <br>	
					     	</p>

						<h4>
							Interviews & Personas
						</h4>
						<p>
							I conducted a number of interviews as part of this project. These interviews followed a semi-structured approach so ensure that important questions related to use of the library was asked of every participant, while still allowing for deep exploration of unexpected subjects. <br>
							Based on these interviews, I created a total of six personas, examples of which are shown here:
						</p>
						   	 <img
               						src="images/Group331.png" alt="" class="media"
             						/>
						   	<br>
						<h4>
							Usability Tests
						</h4>
						<p>
							As part of this project, a functional prototype was created. Using this prototype (and a fairly janky setup), I conducted six usability tests.
						</p>
							 <img
               						src="images/usability.jpg" alt="" class="media"
             						/>
						   	<br>

						<p>
							For this, I created a scenario involving 13 tasks which took the participant through all of the functions of the prototype. <br>
							Through this, we were able to gauge the usability of the prototype, and understand how people intuitively wanted to solve different tasks. <br>
							As part of these tests, I also conducted a quick card-sorting-like tasks, intended to make sure our understanding of different study spaces' characteristics were similar to the users'.
